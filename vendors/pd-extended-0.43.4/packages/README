Adding specific package types
=============================

This directory is for package builders for various platforms.  The
directories here should be named using the following format:

platform_pkgname

So for example, Pd for Windows runs on the Win32 platform, and uses Inno
Setup to create the installer package, so the directory is called:
win32_inno.  This name should also be all lowercase and use an underscore for
a separator.

There are package making files out there that are not in the Pd CVS.  I know
of the PlanetCCRMA RPMs and Mandrake RPMs.  So for example, when these get
checked it, they should be in:

planetccrma_rpm
mandrake_rpm

Standards are good!  ;)
