pix_mano & pix_drum come with their own licenses, see the LICENSE.txt files in the resp. folders.

sources
-------
this package does not contain any sources; you can download the (platform
independent) source package of Gem from either:
http://gem.iem.at
or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pd-gem/

however, this package contains the headers and library file needed to compile
externals for Gem.
you can find them in Gem/dev/

plugins
-------
Gem uses plugins in order to load as many file formats as possible.
some of those plugins are either outdated, unstable or require special system
setups (like purchasing a license key from some vendor).
these plugins are therefore disabled. if you want to enable them, simply copy
them from Gem/plugins-disabled/ into Gem/.


conclusion
----------
have fun
