Quick compilation instructions for Linux or Mac OSX:

There are two parallel build systems: the "old" one by Miller and the "new"
one by Hans.

Old build system: on Macintosh or linux, Change to "src" subdirectory.
Type "./configure", possibly adding flags as follows:

    To put Pd in /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin, add "--prefix=/bin".
    To enable jack support: "--enable-jack"

Then type "make"; and. if desired, as superuser type "make install".

To run pd, either type the full pathname as in /home/me/pd/bin/pd, or else
if you've chosen  "make install", just type "pd".

New build system: in this directory, type "./autogen.sh", then "./configure";
then "make".

Special instructions for Microsoft Windows: to use the old build system,
install the Microsoft C compiler, cd to src and type "make -f makefile.nt". 
Then CD to the various subdirs of extra and type "make nt" in each.  For the
new build system, install cygwin and follow instructions as in linux or
Macintosh.
