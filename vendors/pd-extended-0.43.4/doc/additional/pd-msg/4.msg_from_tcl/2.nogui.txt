This small example show an easy way to use pd without the classical gui.


0) run pd -open recv.pd -nogui
1) run 2.nogui (use wish83 if you are under win xx)
2) chose an abstraction to open, for example test.pd (in this folder)
3) turn the dsp on
4) here you can listen to your abstraction !!!

Enjoy !!!
