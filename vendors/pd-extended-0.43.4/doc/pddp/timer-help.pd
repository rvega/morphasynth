#X text 12 205 HELP_PATCH_AUTHORS This help patch was updated for Pd
version 0.35 test 28 by Dave Sabine as part of a project called pddp
proposed by Krzysztof Czaja to build comprehensive documentation for
Pd. Jonathan Wilkes revised the patch to conform to the PDDP template
for Pd version 0.42.;

if all [delay] and [metro] objects were exact.;

#X text 77 250 NOTE: Unlike most other objects in Pd \, the right inlet
of [timer] is the hot one (i.e. \, a bang to it triggers the output).
;
#X text 98 402 bang;
#X text 168 402 - an initial "bang" to the left inlet starts the timer.
Subsequent "bangs" reset the timer.;

#X text 167 433 - a bang to the right inlet causes the elapsed time
to be output (in milliseconds).;

#X text 21 38 In a fantasy world \, computers could exist somehow beyond
the restrictions of time and digital computation could be performed
in ZERO time. However \, that is not the case. Instead \, every process
within Pd and within your operating system requires at least a few
nanoseconds of your CPU's time.;
#X text 22 123 The [timer] object is like a clock that is not constrained
to the regular laws of physics and the universal space-time continuum.
It reports "time" measurements as only Pd can see them!;
#X text 23 182 The [cputime] object is like a clock that measures how
much time your CPU actually required to carry out your request. Keep
in mind however that your CPU is busy doing many things simoultaneously
\, so even though a process might take 5 minutes to complete \, your
CPU does not pay full attention to that process for the entire 5 minutes.
Instead \, it simply begins the process \, then refers back to that
process from time to time until the it is complete. In other cases
\, your CPU might require a full 5 minutes while Pd might report that
merely a few milliseconds have passed. This type of discrepancy depends
heavily on your computer's hardware and the type of processing it is
performing.;
#X text 24 341 The [realtime] object is as much like your own wrist
watch as Pd can possibly manage. It measures time according to your
operating system's internal clock.;

#X text 21 38 [timer] works like essentially like a stop-watch. Once
it starts \, you can continue to "poll" the [timer] to view the elapsed
time.;
#X text 20 135 As stated above \, [timer] measures "logical" time.
This value may be slightly different that CPU time or "real" time.
PD offers two objects which measure CPU time and "real" time. See the
reference documents for those objects for more information.;

which will force each of Pd's stop-watches \, [timer] [cputime] and
[realtime] to measure various processes and report the elapsed time.

is that a stop-watch can be stopped! [timer] can only be started or
reset. It cannot be stopped.;
