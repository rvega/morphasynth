#X text 25 480 Externals and other Libraries: Each PDDP document includes
mention of "related objects from other Pd libraries" as well as mention
of "related native Pd objects". The objects from other libraries are
available only if you download those libraries from their respective
authors and integrate them properly into your version of Pd. We do
not and cannot maintain a complete list of externals - but we try.
For more info about externals and other objects \, see http://www.puredata.org/
and the Pure Data Base at http://iem.kug.ac.at/pdb/;
