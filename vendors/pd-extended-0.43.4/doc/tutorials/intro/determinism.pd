#X text 9 73 Pd is designed to be "deterministic". This is a computer
science term meaning to behave predictibly \, i.e. given a certain
input \, it will always produce the same output.;
#X text 9 163 For Pd \, this means that it will always run the program
in the exact same order everytime. Even if the computer is not fast
enough to complete all of the operations in realtime \, Pd will then
cause an interruption while it ties to finish everything before moving
to the next step.;
