- finish up 17.atomic_messages.pd

- make new exercise in 26.EXERCISE.hmmmm

- in pure_data_files.pd, make the patch create [pd clone] dynamically,
  probably like how send_messages_to_pd.pd does it.

- in pure_data_files.pd, make the patch reset itself once it finishes the
  clone. (remember that [pd clone] has to be the last object.)

- make looping sequence

- 20.inlets_and_outlets: explain the message building, prepend, add2, set,
     etc.  probalby, I should make a patch or two before that about message
     buildling
