more than a series of pitches \, and seem to have an emergent property
characteristic of the particular pattern- in other words \, they form
distinctive auditory gestalten or temporal compounds. If melodies can
be considered as temporal compounds \, then we would expect to find
a 'temporal template' for melody recognition that has both upper and
lower durational limits." [1];
