#X text 10 63 In computer speak \, a "port" is an interface thru which
data is sent and received. Network ports are numbered \, and can be
1-65535. Network services are usually registered to use a specific
network port. HTTP uses port 80 \, sending email uses port 25 \, IMAP
uses port 143;
#X text 10 140 Before using a network port for your application \,
you should check to make sure that it isn't already used. You can see
a list of registered ports in a file called "services". On UNIX-based
systems \, its located in /etc/services. On Windows \, its located
in C:/WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/services;
#X text 10 231 On UNIX-based systems \, ports 0-1024 can only be used
by the administrator account "root". Windows does not have this restriction.
Most of the ports below 1024 are claimed anyway \, so its best to use
port numbers higher than 1024;
